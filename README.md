# UtilitySnippets

A collection of miscellaneous scripts, code snippets, templates, etc. Some are more polished than others, but they have all served a purpose at one point or another.

## Why are some file paths similar to "C:\TestFile1.txt"?
Because often these scripts were written for a specific purpose, and some have been mildly sanitized for release. The file extensions are always left intact for posterity.
