Regex for finding lines that have mixed tabs/spaces in indentation (specifically at least one tab, followed by N spaces):
^(\s*)\t( +)

Breakdown:
^ = start of string (note: this does not necessarily mean line. This regex is meant to be evaluated on a line-by-line basis!)
(\s*) = any whitespace character, between 0 and infinite times
\t = tab
( +) = space character, between 1 and infinite times
